                    <h5>Introduction</h5>
                        <p>This area of concern contains everything to do with the actual use and exploitation of the software 
                           system to be produced. Software engineering always involves at least one customer for the software 
                           that it produces. The customer perspective must be integrated into the day-to-day work of the team 
                           to prevent an inappropriate solution from being produced.</p>
                    <h5>Contents</h5>
                        <p>In each area of concern there are:</p>
                        <li>Essential things to work with – descriptions of the kind of things that the team will produce, and use in the process of developing good software</li>
                        <li>Essential things to do – descriptions of the challenges the team faces and the activities that the team will perform to meet them</li>
                        <li>Essential competencies – descriptions of the skills that the team require to be able to carry out the activities.</li>

                     <h5>Things to Work With</h5>
                        <p>In the customer area of concern the team needs to understand the stakeholders and the opportunity to be addressed:</p>
                        <li>“Stakeholders”: The people, groups, or organizations who affect or are affected by a software system. The stakeholders provide the opportunity and are the source of the requirements and funding for the software system. They must be involved throughout the software engineering endeavor to support the team and ensure that an acceptable software system is produced.</li>
                        <li>“Opportunity”: The set of circumstances that makes it appropriate to develop or change a software system. The opportunity articulates the reason for the creation of the new, or changed, software system. It represents the team’s shared understanding of the stakeholders’ needs, and helps shape the requirements for the new software system by providing justification for its development.</li>

                      <h5>Things to Do</h5>
                        <p>In the customer area of concern the team has to understand the opportunity, and support and involve the stakeholders:</p>
                        <li>“Explore Possibilities”: Explore the possibilities presented by the creation of a new or improved software system. This includes the analysis of the opportunity to be addressed and the identification of the stakeholders.</li>
                        <li>“Understand Stakeholder Needs”: Engage with the stakeholders to understand their needs and ensure that the right results are produced. This includes identifying and working with the stakeholder representatives to progress the opportunity.</li>
                        <li>“Ensure Stakeholder Satisfaction”: Share the results of the development work with the stakeholders to gain their acceptance of the system produced and verify that the opportunity has been successfully addressed.</li>
                        <li>“Use the System”: Use the system in a live.</li>

                     <h5>Competencies</h5>
                        <p>In the customer area of concern the team has to be able to demonstrate a clear understanding of the business and technical aspects of their chosen domain and have the ability to accurately reflect the views of their stakeholders. This requires the following competencies to be available to the team:</p>
                        <li>“Stakeholder Representation”: This competency encapsulates the ability to gather, communicate, and balance the needs of other stakeholders, and accurately represent their views.</li>
